            <h2>History of COCKTAILS!</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The history of cocktails is a spirited journey, though its precise origins are as muddled as a Mojito. The word "cocktail" itself is a mystery; theories range from a "cock-tailed" horse (a mixed breed) to a specific egg-cup (a coquetier) used for serving.</p>
            <p>What we do know is that by the early 19th century, the concept of a "bittered sling"—a potent mix of spirit, sugar, water, and bitters—was gaining popularity. This is essentially the blueprint for what we'd now call an Old Fashioned.</p>
            <p>The golden age of the cocktail truly began with "Professor" Jerry Thomas, a flashy bartender who published The Bar-Tender's Guide in 1862. This was the first-ever book of cocktail recipes, codifying drinks like the Martinez (a precursor to the Martini) and the Tom Collins, and cementing the bartender as a creative professional.</p>
            <p>A pivotal moment came with Prohibition in the United States (1920-1933). While intended to stop drinking, it merely drove it underground. Speakeasies flourished, and the quality of spirits plummeted. This forced bartenders to become inventive, using juices, syrups, and other strong mixers to mask the harsh taste of bootleg gin and rough-hewn whiskey. This era gave us drinks like the Bee's Knees (honey and lemon to hide bad gin). It also had the unintended effect of spreading American cocktail culture globally, as many top bartenders fled the US to find work in Europe.</p>
            <p>After Prohibition's repeal, cocktails settled into a sophisticated groove, personified by the "Mad Men" era of the 1950s and 60s, dominated by classics like the Martini and the Manhattan. This was followed by a less-distinguished period in the 70s and 80s, which favored artificial mixers and sugary, brightly colored concoctions.</p>
            <p>However, the late 1990s and 2000s sparked a "cocktail renaissance." A new generation of bartenders looked backward, reviving classic recipes, prioritizing fresh ingredients, creating small-batch syrups, and emphasizing craft and technique. This movement, which continues today, has returned the cocktail to its status as a balanced and respected culinary art form.</p>

            <br>
            <p>This site is a personal passion project, built by me, the founder of Aethera. To be honest, it all started because I am just really interested in the art and craft of cocktails—the history, the ingredients, and the joy of creating a perfectly balanced drink.</p>
            <p>Cocktail Mixing Guru actually began as my personal Diwali project. I wanted to use the festive season to build something new, and sharing my love for mixology with the world seemed like the perfect idea.</p>
            <p>Aethera is the name I work under, and this site is a perfect example of what I love to do: build creative projects with passion. My hope is that this site helps you explore new recipes, learn new techniques, and have as much fun mixing drinks as I do.</p>
